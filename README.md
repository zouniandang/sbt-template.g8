# Scala sbt template (Multi-Module with App)

A [giter8][1] template for Scala projects using sbt. 
This template sets up a multi-module project. It also includes an application that depends on the modules. 
An assembly plugin is referenced for building uber-jar of the application.

## Usage

```
sbt new zouniandang/sbt-template.g8
```
or

```
sbt new file://./sbt-template.g8
sbt new file:////<some_path>/sbt-template.g8
```

You can then run:

~~~
sbt compile
sbt publish-local
sbt assembly
~~~

The assembly command will put the uber-jar into a top level 'bin' directory.
